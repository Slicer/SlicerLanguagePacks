Help translate the project on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/3d-slicer/).

## How to use

### Setup

- Download and onstall Qt toolkit. It is free. Go to [Qt website](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source), scroll down, click `Download the Qt online installer` button, and follow the instructions. Any Qt version can be used.
  - Qt is required because it contains the `lrelease` tool, which can compile a human-readable translation file(.ts file, that are edited on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/project/3d-slicer)) to a binary file (.qm file, that the application can use).
  - The Qt company added many misleading statements on its website to try to trick users into buying a commercial license of Qt.
  A commercial license is not needed, even for commercial uses of Qt. The free, open-source version is sufficient.
  - On macOS: installer can be downloaded from [here](https://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-mac-x64-online.dmg) or Qt can be installed using Homebrew. If Homebrew is used then `lrelease` is available by default at `/usr/local/Cellar/qt@5/5.15.2/bin/lrelease`.
  - On Ubuntu, after downloading the Qt Installer from the website, open a terminal and move to the Downloads directory. Then, make the file executable (by changing the permissions) and then run the command "./[filename] to launch the installation. When the installation is done, the lrelease file will be located in "/usr/bin/" .
- [Download](https://download.slicer.org) and install a recent 3D Slicer Preview Release (released 2022-01-28 or later)
- Install SlicerLanguagePacks extension.

- In Slicer, go to `Language Tools` module and set `Qt lrelease tool path`. It is located in the folder where Qt was installed.
  - Default location on Windows is something like this: `c:\Qt\5.15.0\msvc2019_64\bin\lrelease.exe`

### Download and install latest translations

- Download latest translation
  - Option A: `Weblate`. Download selected langauges directly from Weblate. This allows getting the most recent translations immediately, which is useful for translators wanting to test their translated application immediately.
  - Option B: `GitHub`. Download all languages from [SlicerLanguageTranslations](https://github.com/Slicer/SlicerLanguageTranslations) repository. This is the fastest way to get updated translation files for all languages, but these translations files are updated only once a day.
- Compile the translation files and install them into the application by clicking `Update translation files` button.
- Click `Restart the application` button to start using the new translation files.

### Set application language

Language can be selected in menu: Edit -> Application Settings, General section -> Language. If the language selector does not appear then go to "Internationalization" section and toggle the checkbox. The application has to be restarted after changing language.

## Tips and tricks

### Find text tool

`Find text` tool is added for quick extraction of text from the application and find occurrences of that text in the translation website:

- Go to Language Tools module
- Open `Find text` section
- Set edited language: the extracted strings will be opened on the website, showing translations in this language. Example: `fr-FR`, `hu-HU`.
- Check `Enable text finder` checkbox
- Hit `Ctrl+6` shortcut anytime to show the widget selector
- Click on the widget that contains translatable text (hit any key to cancel widget selection)
- Click `OK` to open the found text on the translation website

Known limitations:
- The tool only extract widgets from Qt widgets (not from views rendered by VTK library).
- Extraction text from floating and popup windows is not supported.

## Advanced use

### Install translation files offline

Translation (.ts) files can be downloaded to a folder and installed from there later, without network access.

Translation files can be downloaded from Weblate or GitHub. For example, open [Slicer project in Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/project/3d-slicer) select translation page of a language (such as [French](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/3d-slicer/3d-slicer/fr/)), then in the menu choose `Files` -> `Download translation`.

Install the translation files:
- Select `Local folder` option
- Set the folder containing .ts file(s) in `Input folder` in `Input translations` section.
- Check `Latest file only` option to only use the latest downloaded .ts file. It is useful if local folder is set directly to the web browser's download folder.
- Compile the translation files and install them into the application by clicking `Update translation files` button.
